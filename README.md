This dashboard equips banking professionals and decision-makers with real-time intelligence to:
- Assess overall loan and deposit portfolios.
- Identify revenue drivers, such as fee generation.
- Discover client and regional trends in banking product usage.
- Inform strategic planning for market expansion and client engagement.

**Conclusion:**
Through a focus on intuitive KPIs and targeted visual analytics, this Power BI project delivers a robust platform for banking data exploration, risk assessment, and operational strategy, ensuring greater visibility into client profiles and banking performance.
